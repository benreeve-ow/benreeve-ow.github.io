# The AI Implementation Crossroads

A single-panel cartoon showing a corporate boardroom where an important decision is being made. At the center is a large conference table with executives in business attire. 

On one end of the table sits a calm, relaxed tech person with glasses and casual clothes pointing to a small laptop with "ChatGPT" visible on the screen. A simple speech bubble above them says: "We could just use this for $20 per month."

On the opposite end stands an enthusiastic consultant in an expensive suit with wild hair and animated gestures. They're dramatically pointing at an absurdly complex flowchart titled "PROPRIETARY FINE-TUNED LLM IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP" that covers an entire wall. Their speech bubble reads: "OR we could build our own custom AI for just $2.5 million and 18 months!"

The executives in the middle look confused and overwhelmed, with one whispering to another: "But we're special, right?" while another responds: "Our quarterly reports aren't THAT different from everyone else's..."

The company CEO sits at the head of the table, visibly sweating with dollar signs in their eyes as they look back and forth between the two options.

A small potted plant in the corner wears a name tag that says "Common Sense" and appears to be wilting from neglect.
